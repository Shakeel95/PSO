# PSO

Code in this repository reproduces results presented in my group project for the LSE course [ST444 Statistical Computing](http://www.lse.ac.uk/resources/calendar/courseGuides/ST/2019_ST444.htm). The project was on Particle Swarm Optimisation, a gradient-free heuristic optimization algorithm. This repository contains Python implementations of the classical PSO algorithm of [Clerc and Kennedy](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.460.6608&rep=rep1&type=pdf) as well of the quantum-behaved PSO variant introduced by [Sun et al](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1330875). 

## Directories

The directory structure for this repository is as follows: 

```
PSO
  |
  |--report 
  |
  |-- code
  |   |-- script...py
```

The function of each sub-directory is as follows: 

* `report`: contains a pdf of the report as submitted for the course
* `code`: implementations of PSO and QPSO, as well as functions to test optimisation behaviour

## Depends

Python >= 3.0.0
